# **AI-Driven PDF Pipeline: Automate, Query, and Scale with Airflow and OpenAI**

## Overview
AI-Driven PDF Pipeline is a comprehensive system designed to automate the process of managing PDF files from Hugging Face and uploading them to Azure Blob Storage, while providing users with an intuitive interface for querying OpenAI about PDF content. The solution integrates an automated pipeline built with Airflow for handling PDF uploads, a Streamlit-based frontend for user registration and interaction, and a FastAPI backend for API responses. The entire project is containerized using Docker Compose, ensuring easy deployment and scalability. With secure user authentication and AI-powered Q&A functionality, AI-Driven PDF Pipeline simplifies document management and enhances content exploration with AI insights.

## Key Features

- **Automated Hugging Face PDF Uploads**:
  Utilize Apache Airflow to automate the process of retrieving PDF files from Hugging Face and uploading them to an Azure Blob Storage container.
  
- **Interactive Q&A Interface**:
  A frontend built with Streamlit allows users to ask OpenAI questions about the content of various PDF files and receive dynamic responses.

- **User Authentication & Management**:
  Streamlit provides a user-friendly login and registration system, storing user credentials securely in an Azure SQL Server database.

- **Backend API with FastAPI**:
  The backend, built using FastAPI, serves as the API for handling frontend requests, interacting with the Azure container, and managing user queries.

- **Python Project Management with Poetry**:
  All Python dependencies and virtual environments are managed using Poetry, ensuring consistent environments across development and production.

- **Containerized Services**:
  Docker Compose is used to containerize the entire project, including the Airflow pipeline, Streamlit frontend, and FastAPI backend, ensuring easy setup and scaling.
